                        Hello and welcome, I am Cody Dennhardt and I am a professional developer with many years in the industry. I am a talented individual with an eye for detail, making sure to explore as many approaches and directions necessary to ensure the best possible solutions. Most of my experience is backend development, however from time to time I try to challenge myself by creating intuitive, user friendly frontend designs. You may have noticed this page itself is all custom built, using only the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JS considering the scope.

                        <br><br>

                        Back in highschool I was starting a semester in an Intro to Spreadsheets class which was taught at the same time and in the same room as an Intro to Programming using Python class. I thought that class sounded much more interesting and luckily enough the teacher told us we were allowed to switch into any of the classes he was teaching if we wanted. I switched and never looked back (see you later spreadsheets!) and every week we would gain a new programming assignment. I was so fascinated by being able to tell computers to do things for me I finished the assignments within the first 2 days of it being assigned and had the rest of the week to explore what was possible. I teamed up with my friend in the class Keiran and we made a program that played music using motherboard beeps. I ended the class with a 98%. Thus my journey into programming would continue when I applied for the Bachelor of Computing Science at Thompson Rivers University.

                        <br><br>

                        I'm interested in continuing to learn new technologies and tools, as such this is my first website I've worked on where I got to choose how to deliver it to the world. I ended up going with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as it is one of the largest and most well documented cloud service providers out there, used all throughout the industry. This page is hosted using AWS Amplify with Route 53 for DNS.
